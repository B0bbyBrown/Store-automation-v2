The-Mother-Script.mjs serves as the main entry point for your entire script. 
It coordinates various processes by sequentially calling several main functions from different modules.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of its functionality:


/Imports: The script imports main functions from other modules responsible for specific tasks.

-mainDownload from Download.mjs
-mainConversion from Conversion.mjs
-mainScraper from Scraper.mjs
-mainWooRephrase from WooRephrase.mjs
-mainFinalFilter from Final-Filter.mjs
-mainFinalTouches from Final-Touches.mjs
-There is also a commented-out import for mainSync from WooUpdate.mjs, suggesting it might be used later.
 
 
/Function Execution: The script defines an asynchronous function TheMotherScript which:

-Logs the start of the script.

-Download & Unzip:
 -Calls mainDownload.
 -Logs success or catches and logs errors.

-Conversion:
 -Calls mainConversion.
 -Logs success or catches and logs errors.

-Scraping:
 -Calls mainScraper.
 -Logs success or catches and logs errors.

-Rephrasing:
 -Calls mainWooRephrase.
 -Logs success or catches and logs errors.

-Delay:
 -Introduces a 15-second delay to ensure the rephrasing process is completed.

-Final Touches:
 -Calls mainFinalTouches.
 -Logs success or catches and logs errors.

-Final Filter:
 -Calls mainFinalFilter.
 -Logs success or catches and logs errors.

-Synchronization (commented out):
 -Calls mainSync.
 -Logs success or catches and logs errors.

-Script Execution: Finally, the script calls TheMotherScript to start the execution.
