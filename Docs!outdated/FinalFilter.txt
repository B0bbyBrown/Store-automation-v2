Final-Filter.mjs is responsible for filtering products in a CSV file based 
on specific keywords and saving the filtered products to a new CSV file. 

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of its functionality:


/Imports: The script imports necessary modules:

-loadConfig from configManager.mjs for loading configuration settings.
-createLogger from logger.mjs for creating a logger instance.
-findLatestCSV, filterProductsByKeywords, and saveFilteredProducts from csvHandler.mjs for CSV operations.


/Main Method (mainFinalFilter()):

-Variables:
 -logger: Logger instance for logging information and errors.
 -config: Configuration settings loaded from configManager.mjs.
 -keywords: Keywords for filtering products, retrieved from the configuration.
 -outputDirectory: Output directory for saving the filtered products, retrieved from the configuration.
 -convertedDirectoryPath: Path to the directory containing the converted CSV files (./output/final_touches/).


/Steps:
-Finds the latest CSV file in the converted directory.
-Logs an error if no CSV file is found and exits the function.
-Logs the path to the latest CSV file found.
-Filters products in the CSV file by the specified keywords using filterProductsByKeywords.
-Logs the number of products matching and not matching the keywords.
-If there are matching products:
 -Generates a dynamic folder path for the output file using generateFolderPath.
 -Constructs the output path for the filtered CSV file.
 -Saves the filtered products to the output path using saveFilteredProducts.
 -Logs success if the filtered products are saved successfully.
