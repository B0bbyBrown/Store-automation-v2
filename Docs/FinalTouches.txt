Final-Touches.mjs is responsible for applying the final transformations 
to the CSV data before it’s ready for synchronization. 


Here’s a detailed breakdown of its functionality:


/Imports: The script imports necessary modules:

-fs for file system operations.
-path for handling file paths.
-csv-parser for parsing CSV files.
-stream and Transform for stream transformations.
-csv-stringify for writing CSV files.


/Helper Functions:

-findLatestCSV(directoryPath): 
 -Finds the latest CSV file in a directory and its subdirectories based on the modification time.
-generateFolderPath(): 
 -Generates a folder path based on the current date and time, formatted as YY/MM/DD/HH/mm. Ensures the directory structure exists.
-cleanUp(row): 
 -Cleans up and removes specific columns from the row data (is_essential, is_accessory, is_spare, minimum_allowed_quantity, date_expected, erp_status).
-transformCategoryHierarchy(hierarchy): 
 -Transforms the category hierarchy string into an array of category objects, splitting by >.
-adjustPrice(price): 
 -Adjusts the price by adding 10% and returns the new price formatted to two decimal places.
-transformRow(row): 
 -Transforms each row synchronously by adjusting the price and transforming the category hierarchy. Cleans up the row by removing specific columns.


/Main Method (mainFinalTouches()):

-Variables:
 -latestCSV: The latest CSV file in the ./output/woo_rephrase/ directory.
 -folderPath: The dynamically generated folder path for the output file.
 -newFilePath: The path to the new transformed CSV file within the generated folder.
 -writeStream: Stream for writing the transformed CSV data to the output file.

-Steps:
 -Finds the latest CSV file in the rephrased data directory.
 -Logs an error if no CSV file is found and exits the function.
 -Logs the path to the latest CSV file found.
 -Sets up a dynamic folder path based on the current date and time.
 -Constructs the output path for the transformed CSV file.
 -Reads the latest CSV file, applies transformations to each row, and writes the transformed data to the output file.
 -Stops processing further rows if the product count reaches 500.
 -Logs errors if any occur during the reading or writing process.
